# Sorting Visualiser
A sorting algorithm visualiser written in C#. It is based on a Java project (largely) completed in my spare time a few months ago. It will (hopefully) show disparity dots (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYd_-pAfbBw for a demo).
This project will use [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for first-class, cross-platform support for a GUI.

## New features (compared to the old version in Java)
* Out of place algorithms, such as mergesort and quicksort
