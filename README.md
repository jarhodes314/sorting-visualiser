# Sorting Visualiser
A sorting algorithm visualiser written in C#. It is based on a Java project (largely) completed in my spare time a few months ago. It will (hopefully) show disparity dots (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYd_-pAfbBw for a demo).
This project will use [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for first-class, cross-platform support for a GUI.

## What has been done
* Create basic interface using Eto
* Create support for calculating disparity in a list, either using caching or on-the-fly, implementation as yet untested for both general success & performance

## Things to do
* Create method to draw the visualisations
* Add some algorithms

## New features (compared to the old version, not necessarily implemented yet)
* Out of place algorithms, such as mergesort and quicksort
